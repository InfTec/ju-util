# Contains references and priorization of JU property files.
# We will scan the whole classpath for files named ju.properties.files to load property files
# See JuUtils.getJuPropertyChain for details.
#
# The entries in this file have the form '{priority},{type},{path}', e.g.
#   1,prop,/my.properties
#
# Valid types are:
#  - sys: System properties
#  - prop: Properties file: {resourcePath}[,optional]
#  - csv: CSV file: {resourcePath},{profileProperty}[,defaultColumn]
#
# Lines starting with # and empty lines will be ignored
# Priorities must be unique
# Resources must be unique as well
# Placeholders like %keyName% are supported that will be evaluated using the already built property chain
